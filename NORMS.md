# TEAM RICE FLAVORED CHEETOS NORMS

#### What does this group do when two or more members disagree (ex. on a technical approach, a technology choice, etc)? Do you vote? Does the whole group get involved? Do you get someone else to decide? ####
_- Call open discussion until issue is resolved. Allocate time 1 hour at maximum to resolve conflicts. If nothing has been resolved, bring in a Instructor or fellow to assist._



#### What does this group do when a member is frustrated? What strategy do you use to talk about it? What do you do if you’re the frustrated person? What do you do if you’re the person someone is frustrated with? ####
_- Get a beer. Be open, dont be tough guy. If things ever get serious, the safety word would be 'cheetos' where the group responds with undivided attention until any tension has been resolved._



#### What does this group do when we merge our work together? Do we do it together? Do we require sign off from someone else? ####
_- Everyone does merge after stand-up meetings_



#### When does this group ask for help? After 10 minutes? 15? 20? After everybody’s tried to solve the problem? What strategies do we use before we ask for help? ####
_- After 15 minutes of individual work, call groupmates then instructor afterwards if the problem is still not solved._



#### How do we pair? What do we do when two group members pair with each other? Do members of a pair decide their own norms? Do they do things like keep a timer to switch positions? How often do we switch partners? ####
_- Up to the pair, depending on situation. When two group members pair, try to be clear on implementation goals._



#### How does this group approach work “after hours” (i.e. after normal class hours and weekends)? Is it okay to work on your own after hours? How do we keep the group informed? Do we only work after hours when we can pair? When the entire group is present? ####
_- Please communicate any updates with scheduling. No plans for after hours work on the first week._



#### What time does this group have daily stand up? ####
_- 10:30am after REACTO._
